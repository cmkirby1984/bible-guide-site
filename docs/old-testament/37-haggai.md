## Key Verses

**Haggai 1:5-6** - "Now this is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Give careful thought to your ways. You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.'"
*Significance:* Misplaced priorities lead to frustration - putting self before God results in dissatisfaction despite efforts; divine discipline through futility.

**Haggai 2:4-5** - "'Be strong, all you people of the land,' declares the LORD, 'and work. For I am with you,' declares the LORD Almighty. 'This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.'"
*Significance:* God's presence and Spirit empower His people for the work - divine "I am with you" overcomes obstacles and fear.

**Haggai 2:9** - "'The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,' says the LORD Almighty. 'And in this place I will grant peace,' declares the LORD Almighty."
*Significance:* Promise that future glory exceeds past splendor - fulfilled ultimately in Christ as God's true temple dwelling among humanity.
