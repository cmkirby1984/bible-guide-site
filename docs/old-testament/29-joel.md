Joel uses a devastating locust plague as both judgment and warning of the greater Day of the LORD to come. The prophet calls for urgent, heartfelt repentance, promising that God's gracious nature may lead to relenting from judgment. Beyond judgment lies promise: God will pour out His Spirit on all people and restore His people with abundant blessing. The Day of the LORD brings both judgment for the rebellious and salvation for those who call on the Lord's name.
