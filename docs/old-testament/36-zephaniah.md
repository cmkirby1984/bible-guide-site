## Key Verses

**Zephaniah 2:3** - "Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD's anger."
*Significance:* Urgent call to actively pursue God, righteousness, and humility before judgment comes - seeking offers hope of protection.

**Zephaniah 3:17** - "The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing."
*Significance:* Beautiful picture of God's joy over His people - divine delight and singing reverse the theme of judgment, showing restoration's fullness.

**Zephaniah 1:14-15** - "The great day of the LORD is near—near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the LORD is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry. That day will be a day of wrath—a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom."
*Significance:* Vivid description of the Day of the LORD's terror, establishing urgency for repentance and preparation.
