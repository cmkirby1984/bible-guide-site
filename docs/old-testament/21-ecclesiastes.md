   - Balance between realism about vanity and gratitude for blessings

### Central Message

Ecclesiastes reveals the futility and meaninglessness of life when viewed from a purely earthly perspective ("under the sun"). All human pursuits - wisdom, pleasure, work, wealth - ultimately prove unable to provide lasting satisfaction or meaning. True purpose is found only in fearing God, keeping His commandments, and receiving life's simple pleasures as gifts from Him. The book drives readers to look beyond temporal things to the eternal God who gives life meaning.

## Practical Application

**For Daily Living:**
- **Reject False Sources of Meaning**: Don't seek ultimate satisfaction in career, wealth, pleasure, or achievement—they're all "vanity"
- **Fear God and Keep His Commandments**: This is your core purpose—let it guide every decision
- **Enjoy Simple Pleasures**: Receive food, work, relationships as gifts from God with gratitude
- **Live with Eternity in View**: Remember judgment is coming—this perspective changes how you live now
- **Embrace Mystery**: Accept that you can't understand everything; trust God's wisdom over your own

**For Spiritual Growth:**
- Let Ecclesiastes' realism protect you from naive optimism and from despair
- Use the book's "under the sun" perspective to evaluate where you're seeking meaning apart from God
- Meditate on Ecclesiastes 3:11—God has set eternity in your heart; earthly things will never fully satisfy
- Study how Ecclesiastes drives you to Christ, who gives eternal life and transforms "vanity" into purpose
- Balance Ecclesiastes' somber realism with Proverbs' practical wisdom and Psalms' joyful worship
