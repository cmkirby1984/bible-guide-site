### Central Message

Leviticus teaches that the holy God requires holiness from His people in every area of life.

It points forward to the ultimate sacrifice and perfect High Priest.

## Practical Application

- **Care for the Vulnerable**: Laws about the poor, foreigners, and disabled show God's heart—look for practical ways to help those in need
- **Live Generously**: The sabbatical year and jubilee principles challenge us to hold possessions loosely and give freely
