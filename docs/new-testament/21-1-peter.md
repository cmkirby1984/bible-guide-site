Present suffering refines faith and leads to future glory when Christ is revealed. The letter emphasizes submission to authorities, love for fellow believers, and ready defense of Christian hope. Peter assures readers that suffering is not meaningless - it proves faith genuine and participates in Christ's own sufferings.
