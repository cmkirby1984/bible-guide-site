## Key Verses

**Philippians 2:5-8** - "In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant...he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!"
- *Significance:* The Christ hymn that reveals the pattern for Christian humility—though equal with God, Jesus emptied Himself to become a servant, providing the ultimate model for selfless love and sacrifice.

**Philippians 3:13-14** - "Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."
- *Significance:* Paul's personal testimony of spiritual pursuit, encouraging believers to release past failures and achievements while energetically pursuing spiritual maturity and Christ-likeness.

**Philippians 4:13** - "I can do all this through him who gives me strength."
- *Significance:* Often misapplied, this verse specifically addresses contentment in all circumstances—Paul's declaration that Christ's strength enables him to endure both abundance and need with equal grace.
