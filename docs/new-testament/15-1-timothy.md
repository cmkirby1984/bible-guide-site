## Practical Application

**For Daily Living:**
- **Pursue Godliness**: Make godliness with contentment your goal rather than material wealth - great gain comes from being satisfied in Christ, not accumulating possessions
- **Pray for Leaders**: Regularly pray for those in authority (government officials, employers, church leaders) that you may live peaceful, godly lives
- **Watch Your Life and Doctrine**: Pay careful attention to both how you live and what you believe - persevering in both ensures your spiritual health
- **Flee Evil, Pursue Good**: When tempted by greed, false teaching, or ungodliness, run away decisively and actively chase after righteousness, faith, love, and peace
- **Fight the Good Fight**: Engage in spiritual battle by taking hold of eternal life and standing firm in your faith despite opposition

**For Spiritual Growth:**
- Study the qualifications for elders (3:1-7) as a personal growth guide - these character traits should mark every mature believer
- Recognize that false teaching often begins subtly - develop discernment to identify teaching that strays from sound doctrine
- Practice contentment daily by thanking God for what you have rather than constantly desiring more
- If in leadership, ensure your character matches or exceeds your competence - who you are matters more than what you can do
