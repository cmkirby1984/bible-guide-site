After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."
- *Significance:* The foundational passage on the rapture, providing comfort that believers who die before Christ's return will be resurrected and reunited with living believers in the Lord's presence.
