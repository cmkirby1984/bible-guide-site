- *Significance:* Reveals the dual purpose of grace—it not only saves but also educates believers in godly living, demonstrating that justification and sanctification are inseparable aspects of God's gracious work.

**Titus 3:8** - "This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good."

Various groups within the church are given specific instructions appropriate to their roles. The epistle demonstrates that proper church organization, sound teaching, and godly living are inseparable components of healthy Christianity.

## Practical Application

**For Daily Living:**
- **Be Devoted to Good Works**: Actively look for opportunities to do good - your faith should produce visible fruit in service, generosity, and practical help for others
- **Let Grace Teach You**: Allow God's grace not just to save you but to train you in godliness - saying "no" to ungodliness and "yes" to self-control and righteousness
- **Live as a Good Citizen**: Be subject to governing authorities, show courtesy to all people, and live peaceable lives that adorn the gospel
- **Reject Divisiveness**: After one or two warnings, have nothing to do with those who cause divisions in the church over trivial matters
- **Make Your Faith Attractive**: Live in such a way that your conduct makes the gospel appealing to outsiders rather than giving them reason to criticize

**For Spiritual Growth:**
- Study the character qualifications for elders as a spiritual growth checklist - these traits should increasingly mark your life regardless of official leadership roles
- Meditate on how grace both saves and trains - avoid separating justification from sanctification in your understanding or practice
- Examine whether your beliefs are producing good works - doctrine that doesn't change behavior isn't truly believed
- Balance truth and grace by holding firmly to sound doctrine while showing gentleness and courtesy toward all people
